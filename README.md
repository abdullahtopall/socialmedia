# Social Media Application

This repository contains the source code for a social media application developed by Abdullah Topal. The application is built using Java, and the project is managed with Maven.

## Structure

The project structure is as follows:

* `.mvn/wrapper`: This directory contains the Maven Wrapper, which is an executable Unix shell script used in place of a fully installed Maven.
* `src`: This directory contains the source code for the application.
* `.gitignore`: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
* `README.md`: This is the file you're currently reading.
* `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd`: These are Unix and Windows versions of the Maven wrapper script, respectively.
* `pom.xml`: This is a Project Object Model (POM) file, which is fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.

## Installation

To install and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. If you have Maven installed, run `mvn clean install`.
4. If you don't have Maven, but have the Maven Wrapper, run `./mvnw clean install` (Unix) or `mvnw.cmd clean install` (Windows).
5. Once the build is successful, run the application.
